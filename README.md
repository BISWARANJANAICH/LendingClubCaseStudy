Lending Club Case Study

**Brief Description:**

This repository contains the solution for a case study on predicting loan default using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify key factors influencing loan default, enabling a consumer finance company to mitigate credit loss and optimize loan approval decisions. The dataset includes information on loan characteristics, applicant demographics, and repayment statuses. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, the project uncovers patterns and driver variables that indicate default risk. Visualizations and insights are presented to guide business strategies, ensuring informed and data-driven lending decisions.

## General Information
**Context:**
The company facilitates loans to urban customers through an online platform.
Loan approval decisions impact business profitability and risk exposure.

**Key Risks:**
Loss of business if loans to creditworthy applicants are rejected.

Charged-off: Defaulted, causing credit loss.

**Purpose of Analysis:**

Identify driving factors behind loan defaults (e.g., applicant and loan attributes).
Enable better risk and portfolio management.
