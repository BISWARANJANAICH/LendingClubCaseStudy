Lending Club Case Study

**Brief Description:**

This repository contains the solution for a case study on predicting loan default using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify key factors influencing loan default, enabling a consumer finance company to mitigate credit loss and optimize loan approval decisions. The dataset includes information on loan characteristics, applicant demographics, and repayment statuses. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, the project uncovers patterns and driver variables that indicate default risk. Visualizations and insights are presented to guide business strategies, ensuring informed and data-driven lending decisions.

## General Information
**Context:**
The company facilitates loans to urban customers through an online platform.
Loan approval decisions impact business profitability and risk exposure.

**Key Risks:**
Loss of business if loans to creditworthy applicants are rejected.
Financial losses if loans to risky applicants are approved and they default.
Dataset Description:
Contains information on past applicants, loan statuses, and default history etc.

**Key categories:**
Fully Paid: No issues, loan closed.
Current: Still paying, no defaults.
Charged-off: Defaulted, causing credit loss.

**Purpose of Analysis:**

Identify driving factors behind loan defaults (e.g., applicant and loan attributes).
Enable better risk and portfolio management.

## Conclusions
- Higher interest rates are linked to default loans (Charged Off) and lower grades
- Default rates increase as grades worsen (A to G)
- Loans for small_business and debt_consolidation show higher defaults.
- Lower ratios (<2x income vs. loan amount) are associated with higher defaults.
- Loans with shorter terms (36 months) tend to have a higher default rate compared to longer terms (60 months).
- Open account does not impact on loan defaulter.
